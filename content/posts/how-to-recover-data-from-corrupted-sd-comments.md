This was a real saver.  
  
I had my brother save 30GB worth data in my pendrive, only to accidentally format it, by connecting it improperly, to a settop box. I tried few of the software listed amongst the top 5 best free file recovery software 2016. Some had difficult GUI to work with, while others had an upper limit on the data that could be recovered. Nevertheless none of them worked for me, except for the ZAR, mentioned in the post above. The recovery process was pretty straight forward. And the tool was free for the media files I needed. The real surprise, however, was the recovery of even unintended files, that I had deleted several months earlier.  
  
I remember the panic call I gave you last night bro :) Thanks a ton for the reference, the blogpost, and the timely save of my (technically your) data.
