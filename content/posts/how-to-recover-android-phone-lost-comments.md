What if that phone's data subscription was temporarily suspended when it was lost, with no feasible way of having the service resume within a timely manner? The device can still connect to wifi, and technically the carrier towers, but the Device Manager has been useless (can't track it, don't know if the ring or lock work, not trying Delete until last resort) and I cannot get AndroidLost to install remotely.  
  
Any insight you could give me would be appreciated. I'm running out of ideas... :(  
  
(The device in question is an HTC One, upgraded to the latest OS available on Verizon.)

Sorry. I don't know a way to remotely turn on mobile data for now. Just keep hoping for the best. Don't try to find it by yourself and get help from police. There are also many other apps like AndroidLost. You can try those too.

I'll try to find a way. If you were able to get your mobile back, please share it!
