Its been a big asset for photographers for a long time but it is time to leave the flash device in the museum. A new image sensor could make it possible for the photographers to take Clear, sharp photos even on dim lighting.

The new sensor, created by a team of researchers at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is highly sensitive to both visible and infrared light which means it could be used from family nikon to surveillance and satellite cameras.  
  
This sensor which is 1000 times more sensitive than the imaging sensors of today's cameras gets this high photo response from the honeycomb structured compound of carbon known as Graphene that is  
  
as flexible as rubber, more conductive than silicon and which resists heat better than a  
  
diamond. The inventor of the new sensor, Wang Qijie, an assistant professor at NTU's School of  
  
Electrical and Electronic Engineering, said this is the first time that a broad-spectrum, high  
  
photosensitive sensor has been made using pure graphene.  
  
Wang said the key to his new sensor is the use of "light-trapping" nanostructures that use  
  
graphene as a base. The nanostructures hold onto light-generated electron particles for much  
  
longer than conventional sensors.  
  
If the industry chooses to adopt his design, Wang said it could lead to cheaper, lighter  
  
cameras with longer battery lives for all.
