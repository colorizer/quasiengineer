Have you seen the movie "Back to the future"? If so, do you remember the year Marty went back to future? It was 2015. Do expect Marty to bump into you soon! But wait, there must be a hoverboard for his escape?! What's he gonna do? I think that worried Lexus too much that it has come out with actual one!  
  
The Toyoto company had already hinted its "flying cars" try outs where flying, according to them, meant that car is just a little bit away from the road, so it doesn’t have any friction or resistance from the road.. Now, its Lexus luxury division has brought something back to the future - Hoverboards.  
Lexus released a 38 seconds teaser showing a Hoverboard aka SLIDE with not much disclosure about its specification.  
_[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/wait-a-minute-did-lexus-actually-make-a-working-hoverb-1713469352)_ heard from the carmaker that this project has been in development over the last 18 months, but couldn't get more specific info on how it works.  

### What do we know?

The board uses liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductors and magnets, according to the Lexus website. The technology is already zooming around Toyota's home country. A Japanese railway company last year set a new world speed record using a magnetic-levitation train. Toyota tipped its hand a year ago that it’s been experimenting with this for cars.  
Though it looks like this hoverboard is working on plain ground, [Engadget](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CCYQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2015%2F06%2F23%2Flexus-slide-hoverboard-magnets-teaser%2F&ei=zeqKVf3jLqii7AbqoqHIBA&usg=AFQjCNErQICAbRmwt9-MMOUE2ledb04oYA&sig2=a-Sd2FYp3KFZjYtTNQs-gg&bvm=bv.96440147,d.ZGU&cad=rja) confirmed that the ground has metal rails below.  
Here is the Youtube video:  

 And, to put things synonymous with the movie, Lexus says it'll disclose more information further down the road—specifically on Oct. 21, 2015, the day Doc, Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer went back to the future!
