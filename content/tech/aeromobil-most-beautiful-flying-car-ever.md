Man must be crazy. He dreams. He invents his dream. Then he dreams about his invention. Then he re-invents it! Just as they have quoted:  
  

> "Mark my word: A combination of Airplane and Motor car is coming. You may smile but it will come".

> \- Henry Ford, 1940

And it has come true with AeroMobil 3.0! It is most beautiful Flying car ever made on earth. And it is not the beauty that makes you wonder. But a strange familiarity that makes you feel "This is totally gonna work"!  
  
AeroMobil is a flying car that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes, and opens doors to real door-to-door travel. As a car it fits into any standard parking space, uses regular gasoline, and can be used in road traffic just like any other car. As a plane it can use any airport in the world, but can also take off and land using any grass strip or paved surface just a few hundred meters long.  
  
And, AeroMobil 3.0, the latest edition of the flying car development (which they had started in 1990) doesn't fail you as a car or as a plane.
