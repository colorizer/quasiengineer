I recently came across an interesting post in Reddit. [djberto,](https://www.reddit.com/user/djberto) a Redditor, has shared a link to a forum talk which happened exactly 14 years ago when iPod was first released.  
Today people are hailing Apple's products as innovative and as the thing that changed the Electronic Industry. But that day?!  
  
Here are some excerpts:  

> "Sounds very revolutionary to me. ![:mad:](http://forums.macrumors.com/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png "Mad    :mad:")  
>   
> hey - heres an idea Apple - rather than enter the world of gimmicks and toys, why dont you spend a little more time sorting out your pathetically expensive and crap server line up? ![:mad:](http://forums.macrumors.com/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png "Mad    :mad:")  
> or are you really aiming to become a glorified consumer gimmicks firm?"

Another one claimed that this is not revolutionary!  

> "I still can't believe this! All this hype for something so ridiculous! Who cares about an MP3 player? I want something new! I want them to think differently!Why oh why would they do this?! It's so wrong! It's so stupid!"

 But the biggest concern seemed to be for the Price tag!  

> "OH NO! Just checked Apple Store - they want $399.00 for this thing...Ouch!!!"

And they actually believed that this Product line will fall.  

> "$400 for an Mp3 Player!  
> I'd call it the Cube 2.0 as it wont sell, and be killed off in a short time...and it's not really functional. 

> Uuhh Steve, can I have a PDA now?"  

 But, some people were positive about iPod.  

> "We live in the YEAR 2001... not 6000 years from now when ridiculously awsome technology will exist. No other mp3 player has a harddrive like this... 5gigs... \*\*\*\* yeah. A rio of the same size offers 64megs. Jesum Crow, get over your moping.. .this is revolutionary.... plus it's just the beggining. This device litterally bests anything on the market by about 100x"

But, some people did some serious math though!  

> " I really wanted to like it. Really. But do the math:  
>   
> 20GB hard drive: $199 from APS tech.  
>   
> MP3 player: $50 from Best Buy.  
>   
> You save $150 plus get an extra 15 Gig of storage!"

And this is how I expected a normal person (In my point of view) would react!  

> "This is not like any other MP3 player on the market, imagine being able to store several days worth of music at once! The iPod will be great for travelers, students, heck anyone who is really into music. I think this will be a  
>   
> The price isn't that high, I think the Intel Pocket Concert costs the same or more and only has 128MB of ram, not upgradeable. Plus those little storage cards cost a fortune, like $200 for 128 megs, and there are a lot of incompatible types.  
>   
> Firewire is fast! It must be a pain to transfer files to your player via USB or even a dedicated card reader.  
>   
> I've seen one of the other HD music players and it probably weights double what the iPod weights, as well as being much thicker and bulkier, like a brick basically."

Though, these all are funny and wierd, it represents how fast our life is changing. A commentor mentioned that he could get 20gigs for $200. Well, now we can get 2TB for less than $100. As one [redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3q3mg9/14_years_ago_steve_jobs_announced_the_ipod_and/cwbyf36) puts it, "Things are changing, and while it might not seem amazing as you live your life through it, if you can gain a little perspective, things start to be incredible."  
  
If iPod can change from this to what its now, who knows what can happen? May be, we will be wearing [Nike's new SciFi shoes](http://technologyinfinite.blogspot.in/2015/10/nike-brings-back-to-future-shoes-alive.html) next year by this time!!
