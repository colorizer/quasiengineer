It had been quite a fun with all those "Back to the future Day" celebrations where we bragged to the people of the past that their dreams had become somewhat a reality. (For all those who doesn't understand, Oct 21, 2015 is the day to which Marty in "[Back to the Future II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/)" jumps from the past!)  
  
But, Nike has indeed made it quite a day with the releasing of "Power-laced" Nike Mags. Before I go deep people, these aren't Rocket Booster shoes and so, don't get your hopes high!  
  
These are actually Self-lacing shoes which uses an individually responsive system that senses the wearer’s motion to provide adaptive on-demand comfort and support. That means two things:  

1.  You don't have to tie laces.
2.  You won't have anymore of those too-tight too-loose situations.

 Nike actually designed these shoes for the Movie and have now made it a reality!  
What's more, Nike says the "power laces" tech is only in its infancy, calling what these Mags feature a first iteration of it. The company added that it is currently testing this across a wide range of sports, as it wants and hopes to bring it to other footwear in the future -- at least in areas where it makes sense.  
  
And the first one to wear the Nike Mags is Marty (Michael J. Fox) himself!
