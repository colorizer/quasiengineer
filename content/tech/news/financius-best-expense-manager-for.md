There are so many apps Play Store to manage expenses but none of them has made me feel comfortable as this app. This app, Financius, has all you need - a smooth interface ( reminding me more about Google+), a neat and efficient way to manage your money, an app lock feature to secure your expense lists and finally all these features for free (with no ad!).

This app provides the account feature to manage money in different accounts. You can create transactions to add expenditures, income (both have their own categories and sub-categories from which you can choose or create more) or to transfer money from one account to another account. This way of representing the expenditure represents the way the real world functions. This makes managing money more easier.

The interface of this app this app is very smooth and follows the cards UI which Google and Windows has started to follow recently. This makes the app really easy and cool.
