Internet Explorer. Yeah, you heard it right. In the recent tests run by the [7tutorials](https://www.7tutorials.com/), the recent version of internet explorer has outscored other browsers by even hours.

For the testing procedure, he took three devices, both old and new.  
  

*   ¬†A brand new Toshiba Encore 8" tablet
*   A brand new Microsoft Surface Pro 2
*   An old HP Pavilion dv 7

  

And he installed the latest version of all the major¬†browsers: Internet Explorer 11(both touch and desktop versions), Firefox 26,¬†Chrome 32 and Opera 18. Windows 8.1 was¬†installed on all test devices, it was up-to-date¬†and all the browsers had no add-ons or toolbars¬†installed.

While IE 11 touch topped the test in Toshiba tablet giving an astonishing time of 8 hours and 52 minutes (firefox and chrome gave only around 6 hours and 30 minutes), IE 11 desktop ¬†topped the list in other two.  
Opera 18 had given the worst battery life in all these devices.

All these devices had Windows 8.1 installed. So, if you want a little longer browsing experience in your windows device, opt for Internet Explorer 11.
