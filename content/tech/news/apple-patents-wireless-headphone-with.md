With Apple unveiling iPhone 6s in less than two weeks, we all are eager to hear the innovations Apple has in store for us. But, according to [AppleInsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/27/apple-researching-noise-cancelling-wireless-earphones-with-bone-conduction-tech), Apple is also looking into technologies for Wireless headphones that could make the iExperience even better.

According to a newly discovered patent application, Apple is studying a new bone conduction technology for wireless headphones that might one day be sold alongside new iPhones.  
  
The patent describes smart headphones that would rely on complex sound monitoring to deliver a better sound experience to the user focusing on enhancing voice communications. The described system would be able to analyze the voice quality of a user, after accepting it with the built-in microphones, and wirelessly send the best version of it to the mobile device.  
Apple‚Äôs proposed system would take into account audio information received from internal earbud microphones, including spoken language, noise and wind level. Furthermore, the software would combine that information with accelerometer output, battery level and earbud position data, compare quality and then select the appropriate noise reduction operation for sending the best outgoing sound possible.

The headphones, which would include a variety of microphones, accelerometers and batteries (see image above), would relay the information to an iPhone or another device independently. The system would be able to discern which audio data to use, and, interestingly, it¬†would be able to pick up sound directly through human bone and tissue.  
These smart headphones would also be able to tell whether they‚Äôre actually inside the user‚Äôs ears, and adjust activity accordingly. Since these would be wireless headphones that would rely on battery power to deliver sound, energy considerations are also a factor in how the technology could work.  
Though these look promising, these are patents and we can't be sure when Apple would release a real Product.
