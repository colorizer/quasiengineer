Google glass is finally revealing its expected wonders at last. Here are the three things that happened and the last one being the most expected.  
  

Shipping in few days:
---------------------

Earlier today, Google announced that it is about to ship the first unit of Google glass in few days to the "Glass Explorers" who signed up at the Google's I/O developer conference last year. Here is the email they sent to

Application Programming Inteface:
---------------------------------

Access to the API itself, it’s worth noting, is still in limited preview and only developers who have access to the Glass hardware will be able to work with the API. Everybody else can also start working on apps based on the documentation but won’t be able to test them.

This [first version of the API](httpss://developers.google.com/glass/v1/reference/), which will allow developer to write what Google likes to call “Glassware,” is still relatively limited and the most advanced feature developers get access to is probably the Glass wearer’s [location](httpss://developers.google.com/glass/location). Because every application communicates with Glass through Google’s servers, the API provides developers with a set of restful services and is completely cloud-based and none of the code will actually run on Glass itself.

  

Specs:
------

Google finally released the specs for its glass and it is as what it was expected to be.

### 

*   Fit:

The glass has got an adjustable nosepads and durable frame that fits any faces.

It also ships with extra nosepads in two sizes.

### 

*   Camera:

Photo - 5MP

Video - 720p HD

### 

*   Display:

It has got a high resolution display which is equivalent to  a 25 inch HD screen from eight feet away. In developer's guide, Google says photos should have a 640x360px resolution, so that’s probably also the resolution of the Glass display, though Google interestingly doesn’t note this in the specs.

### 

*   Audio:

Bone Conduction Transducer - The coolest feature, however, is probably thebone conduction transducer, which will transmit sound from Glass to the inner ear through the bones of the wearer’s skull. Thanks to this, users won’t have to use a regular headphone to use Glass.

### 

*   Memory:

Google glass has got a total memory of 16 GB of which 12 GB is usable. It is also synced with Google's cloud storage.

### 

*   Battery:

The company says the device should have enough battery power to last a full day “_of typical use_,” but it also warns that features like Hangouts and video recordings are more battery intensive.

### 

*   Charger:

Included Micro-usb cable and charger - While there are thousands of Micro USB chargers out there, Glass is designed and tested with the included charger in mind. Use it and preserve long and prosperous Glass use.

### 

*   Compatibility:

Google glass is compatible with any bluetooth enabled phone but it needs Android 4.0.3 (Icecream Sandwich) or higher for its Myglass Companion App which enables GPS and SMS messaging.

### 

*   Cost:

The google glass is supposed to be available for $1500. This is for only "Glass explorers" at present..

  
Finally, its here... and, surely it'll change the way we live. May be this is too much but Welcome to the Digital Life!
