This one mobile OS made quite a buzz previously with its elegant design and dock to run desktop features as they say on their web site "Your phone is more immersive, the screen is less cluttered, and you flow naturally from app to app with edge magic. The phone becomes a full PC and thin client when docked." Let us see what they are offering.

The Welcome Screen:
-------------------

While Samsung and Apple fought for patents including that for the Lock screen, Ubuntu came up with a better idea. Why use the screen to lock things up while it can be used as a welcome sign? There is no lock screen in this OS but you have got a beautiful welcome screen that welcomes you with pleasantness.This isn't a lock screen, it’s a sign saying: “come in”. This screen is also dynamic which means it would change over time to make your life easier. This one also shows the notifications for phone calls, messages, tweets etc.

  

Apps at your Fingertips(the edge magic):
----------------------------------------

Apps has always been at your fingertips but it has never been easier like this.

  
  

*   A short swipe from the left edge of the screen is all it takes to reveal your favorite apps. Ubuntu lets you switch faster between running and favorite apps than any other phone.
*   A full left-to-right swipe takes you to your home screen showing all your running apps.
*   A swipe from the right edge takes you back to the last app you were using; another swipe takes you back to the app you used before that. It’s natural to keep many apps open at once, which is why Ubuntu was designed for multitasking.
*   Swiping up from the bottom edge of the phone reveals app controls. You can hide or reveal them instantly, which means they don’t take up room on the screen, leaving you free to focus on the stuff that matters.

  

App ecosystem:

Another big intuitive feature of Ubuntu phone is that it integrates web apps and native apps and treat them all as one. There is no more jumping to browser to access a website. Web appsget their own icons and the same access to system notifications. So apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, Gmail and Spotify are all available – and thanks to Ubuntu’s web app APIs, it’s easy for web developers to install theirsites as full applications. Native apps are blazingly fast, taking advantage of the full capabilities of the phone’s processor and graphics hardware. Ubuntu phone native apps are based on QML/QT computer language and so they won't drain the battery like android which is based on JAVA.

  

A Bigger Search:
----------------

Ubuntu doesn't just search your phone. It searches you, I mean, it searches for what you want. If it’s a person, you’ll see data from your email and phone contacts alongside Facebook friends and followers on Twitter. The search doesn't stop within your phone. It extends to your Cloud accounts, Social accounts, even online retailers including Amazon and the Ubuntu One Music Store.  

  

Cleverer Conversation:
----------------------

Ubuntu reinvents the inbox, giving you quicker access to all your emails, texts, calls and social media posts. See every message as it comes in and reply in an instant. Whichever app you are in, just swipe down from the top when a new one arrives and respond directly to Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS and good old-fashioned telephone calls. 

  

Dock into PC:
-------------

If this OS got a killer feature, this is it. This OS can run as full desktop computer when docked to a monitor which means, your phone will be used as a CPU for this new world computer.

  

  

The features this OS is offering is great but we have to wait a little long. There won't be any Ubuntu touch devices until 2014. Many critics say that this one can't survive, can't make it into the giant arena of touch devices but according to me, time is the answer.
