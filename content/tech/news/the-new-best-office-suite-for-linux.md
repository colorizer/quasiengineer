I can't deny that. But, when was the last time it actually looked.. cool? If I want to make a "You-don't-want-MSOffice" speech and point at the Libre, it would leave me standing there like a fool. Alas, the worst first impression ever! But, that problem is kinda solved now, I guess. With the WPS Office suite for Linux, we are now the proud owners of "Cool-looking" Office Suite! It is released by the 25 year old Kingsoft Office and maintained by an Open Source Community, WPS Office sure do look like a matured software.  
Most of its look are ripped out of MS Office 2010 but who can complain if it works so well. I had secretly wished that ubuntu would make its own version of Microsoft's ribbon interface for Menus as it will bring more usability on this whole "convergence" thingy. Seeing it on WPS was a bliss for me(Don't get angry. FOR ME only)
