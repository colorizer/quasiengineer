What will happen if your iPhone runs out of charge at the crucial time? It will become a cruel time. But there is no need to be afraid of this anymore. Ideation Designs LLC has come up with device called Infinity cell to make sure that your device remains charged.  

  

                     

  
  

The Infinity Cell is a kinetic charger for the iPhone that uses your body’s movement to generate electricity. The current prototype for the Infinity Cell is a crude 3D printed rectangle, roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes, linked up to the iPhone with a cable. The plan is to create a more streamlined version during the product’s Kickstarter campaign.

When you shake the Infinity Cell for 30 minutes, that provides enough power to give the iPhone a 20 percent charge. When you shake the Infinity Cell for three hours, that provides enough power to fully charge the iPhone. Of course, no sane person is going to sit around shaking his iPhone for three hours to grab a charge. The Infinity Cell eventually aims to generate power from the slightest bit of movement.

The finished model will resemble a Mophie or MaxBoost battery case. You simply slip your iPhone into the case, put in your pocket, and the movement you create when you’re walking, jogging, or biking will power your iPhone. They’re also planning on releasing an Infinity Cell iOS app that will track your energy saving, carbon offset, and gamify the experience by granting users badges as they reach different energy saving rankings.

  

The creators of Infinity Cell are seeking to raise $155,000 on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/358170719/infinity-cell-kinetic-charger) by June 6th. A $125 contribution will nab you an Infinity Cell of your own, although it’s only compatible with iPhone 4 and 4S for now.
