The people has moved into smart world and so had the thieves. But a commoner would not realise that his phone can be stolen until he loses it. And so there is less chance that he had installed security apps in it. Once it gets stolen, all he can do is to worry.. Well, that is past now. With [Androidlost](https://www.androidlost.com/), you can install the security app even after you have lost your phone.  
  
Android Lost not only locates  
by GPS (or network), but can also  
remotely wipe or lock your phone,  
take pictures, send message popups,  
get call lists, erase the SD card , record sound from the microphone, start an  
alarm, and much more‚Äîmaking it a  
great security app.  
You can install the app from the  
Google Play site, and then send an  
SMS to register your device with the  
Android Lost website where you  
control the phone. If you have tablet  
without SMS, you can still remotely  
register the phone with the Jumpstart  
app.

example, or remotely control your  
Android device from afar.
