Windows 8 brought an innovative and stylish interface to Windows but it also brought some annoying changes like clicking or tapping around four times to shut down your computer. You would have felt that it would be lot better if the shut down option was in the start screen. The following method fixes that annoyance by creating a one-click or one-tap tile for shut down in the start screen. Just do as follows:

1.  Head to the Desktop mode by pressing Windows+D or clicking the Desktop tile.
2.  Right-click on an open space on the desktop and go to New > Shortcut.
3.  In the location field, type **shutdown /p** and then click Next, then Finish.
4.  Right-click on the new shortcut and choose Pin to Start.

Now, you will have the Shutdown tile in your Start screen making things easier. You can also create the Restart tile by usingÂ **shutdown /r /t 0** (zero, not the letter "o" at the end) in step 3. Hope this lets more air through your windows!
