Have you ever played [Atari breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game))? Don't think it is the latest action game from Atari. It is not the latest. Its not even old. Its a vintage game belonging to 1970s. But it is the latest among the Google trends. Why? Because it is the latest easter egg found from Google.

No more mystery. Its just a game you can start playing if you google for a atari breakout (available for pc and tab only).  
  
  

1.  Open the image search.
2.  Search for [atari breakout](httpss://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=atari+breakout).
3.  Start playing the game!

Once you start playing the game, you realize that it is game you have already played but without knowing its original name (or atleast I have).  
  
"In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play."  
  
But, of course, in this "Image Breakout" of google, you have to break the images instead of bricks!  
  
Though this not the first easter egg from Google (Google for "do a barrel roll" if you doubt it), this is the first image search easter egg from Google. And I had some cool time breaking images!
