I, during a normal visit to reddit, stumbled upon a post telling us how to View and Share your iPhone screen on Macbook. There are two ways in which this can be done.  

#### Needs:  p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { }

*   OS X Yosemite on the MacBook.
*   iOS 8 on the iPhone (mostly on models from iPhone 5)
*   Ligtning Cable
*   QuickTime Player in the Macbook

####  Steps:

1.  Connect the iPhone to the Macbook using the Ligtning Cable.
2.  Open the QuickTime player in your Macbook. It might be on your dock or through Macbook's applications folder on the hard drive.
3.  In the QuickTime, go to File-->New Movie Recording. A new window appears probably showing you the feed from your Webcam.
4.  Next to the red Record button, click the menu arrow and change the Camera input from FaceTime HD Camera to iPhone. 
5.  If you want to record the audio from the phone, as from a game or app, select the iPhone for the microphone input as well.
6.  Once you have selected the iPhone, click the Record button in the QuickTime window and then perform the tasks on the iPhone you wish to capture as a video. 
7.  After you finish and click the Stop button to have QuickTime finish recording, you can save the newly recorded clip to your Mac’s hard drive.
