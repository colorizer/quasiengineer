Today, there has been some heavy lifting! User defined types, dynamic memory, pointers and all its associated magics! Definitely will be revisiting soon. Also, want to acknowledge that I'm finding the method of logging everything here in blog to be too daunting. If I try to make it useful, the post needs to be lengthy but that eats up the time on learning itself. I'm gonna switch back to the [100 Days of Code github repo for daily tracking for now](https://github.com/colorizer/100-days-of-code). If at all a need rises, I'll try to make it into a separate useful blog post rather than a log. Also, I'll make a log here when I'm done with this fortran course which is due in two weeks.

:)
