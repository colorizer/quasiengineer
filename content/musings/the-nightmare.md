With eyes wide open

They peep into their nightmare

Shedding light so bright

It creeps into their bedtime

  

Rectangular devious piece of hell

Stuck to hand and life

Technological advancement I won't see

Coz, eyes can't see its infidelity.

  

When world turns around

The nights do stay

As the day comes around

The nightmare stays

  

Aint that the one

That she got for her birthday?

Aint that the thing

He bought when he won Game?

  

Come in papa, its so fun

Her call is hefty with world in hand

Another time darling, I smile

That gloated at dead end.

  

Bundled medicines found right here

Insominious existence.

Bundles of light float right there

Insominious existence.

  

My Lashes find their way back

To be halved by barbarous Nightmare

But Life is so much fare

With Real facsimiled of the Reel.

  

On the rim of heart

I wish for a Nightmare

One cruel childish peril filled night

One nightmare as it used to be.
