The quest for the long lost pearl  
Is what brought me to the sea  
This saline fabric of the endless ravel  
Is what's gonna fulfill my dream.  
  
The smothering grasp of the deep blue  
Rattles my heart's grith  
Still I dive deep inside  
For that pearl is worth every breath I breathe.  
  
Beyond the wrecks of past and future  
Is a bed of dank green seaweeds  
Among the tangles of those lazy laces  
Shines bright my love, the pristine white!  
  
  
My breath and faith race against time  
As I fiercely yank for a final embrace  
My hand clinches the white dream  
And in its comfort, I meet the endless peace!
