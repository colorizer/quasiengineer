Eyes filled with unembraced sleeps  
Looks tired on a face with overdefined age lines  
Yet a weak smile blooms that's brought out by thoughts of  
Pockets filled with money that can pull through another day  

Hands too tired to wash away the dirt  
Still hold tools tight as they feed him everyday  
The tired legs carry him home through the roads he laid  
That's how, everyday, his dawn breaks.
