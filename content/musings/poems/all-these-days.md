All these days look like violent storm  
Brewing darkness with lightnings and thunders.  
All these efforts carry a silent tear  
A dreary run to repair the past and the future.  
As the clock ticks out the time's slow death  
We try again and again to rise above the rest.  
For all that we want to do  
Can only be done  
If the heart tastes that rare fruit of  
Hard-earned success.
