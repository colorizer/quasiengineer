A little Learning is a dang'rous Thing;    
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring:    
There shallow Draughts intoxicate the Brain,   
And drinking largely sobers us again.  
Fir'd at first Sight with what the Muse imparts,  
In fearless Youth we tempt the Heights of Arts,  
While from the bounded Level of our Mind,  
Short Views we take, nor see the lengths behind,  
But more advanc'd, behold with strange Surprize  
New, distant Scenes of endless Science rise!  

-Alexander Pope
