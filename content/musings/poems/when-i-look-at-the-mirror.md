Million shimmers of broken glasses  
Singing the dirge of the world they once lived  
An aged tale of life and death  
Eating the living souls relentlessly.  
Against this ocean of merciless despair  
A lone figure with metallic heartbeats  
A warmonger standing up for life  
A storm that's out of breath  
A dead soldier ready to die again.
