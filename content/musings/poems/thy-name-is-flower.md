Gentle you are, clearing the glooms off life;  
Ye are the gentle.  
Glory you are, making smile in frowns;  
Ye are the glory.  
Prop you are, possessing my world;  
Ye are the prop.  


Thou caress my heart more than any soul;  
Ye are the care.  
Thee stash my feel beneath thy bosom;  
Ye are the feel.  
Thee form love inside the void;  
Ye are the love.  


Thy petals are wings that carry the heart;  
Ye are the heart.  
Thy dew is the bathe that instills the pure;  
Ye are the pure.  


Thy stalk teaches me brave of the bold;  
Ye are the bold.  
Thy fragrance is soft even than the air;  
Ye are the soft.  
Thy virtuous nectar is the spring of life;  
Ye are the life.  
Thy white wet my heart with snow;  
Ye are the snow.  


Thou are the grace adorning the Lord.  
Thy name is Jasmine, the flower.
