When your eyes blink and mind is blank    
And heart feels at a lower rank    
When life is like a boat that sank    
Across a river that has no bank    
When talents of glory seems so dank  
Pause and hear the distant clank.  
  
  
Its not the war that burns your brain  
But the power of heart to live through pain.  
  
  
Feel your heartâ€™s endless crank  
Let it be the last time you shrank  
Feel the power, feel that thank  
Feel that adventure you can swank  
Then you can actually yank  
And break free of this delusional tank!
