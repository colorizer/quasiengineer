There was this little town    
Where no one ever dreamt    
For they had a night too dark  
That snuffed out everything.  
  
After years of despair  
As the darkness reigned  
There bloomed a lone <font color='#d80e0e'>red rose</font>  
In the nowhere's middle.  
  
With the drifting wind  
As her only aide  
She sent her sweet scent  
To every soul she could find.  
  
Through door creases  
And tiny cracks in roofs  
She seeded dreams  
That only dreamers knew.  
  
Next day, when they woke up  
They smiled anew.  
As they now had an elixir  
That kept their heart kindled.  
  
Yet they had this feeling  
That they're missing someone.  
What's sinister this time is  
It's someone they never knew.  
  
They wished to look for her  
But couldn't.  
Coz, they had nothing to describe her  
Except the <font color='#d80e0e'>love</font> that remains.
