An arrow silhouetted by the sun  
An effort watched by eagerful eyes  
As the fish darts towards the glass wall  
With so much love for the world afar.  
The warped view bends the truth  
Which the arrow never knew.  
Eagerful eyes stay eagerful for now  
As fish falls back for another chance.  
  
The rise of arrow comes to end.  
Earth stays still.  
This time the wall will be shattered by fish  
And the sizzled pieces will pave way  
Warped eyes will see more then.  
The arrow will find its mark.  
All these moments stay aflame  
while the arrow and the fish take the aim.  
  
Through the prey, to the earth  
The arrow kisses gravity.  
A thunk against the solid wall  
The warped meets the eagerful.  
The swoosh becomes the infinite clinks.  
The arrow with duty done awaits the master.  
With Eagerful eyes watching beyond  
With air of freedom strangling around.  
  
The hunter comes for the prey  
The arrow awaits a new job in home  
A eagerful hand finds the fish  
And thuds against the neighboring glass  
Unbroken among the broke.
