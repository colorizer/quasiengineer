From the deep oceans to the valleys beyond  
Everything stinks with our sinful errands  
Deep from within, the heart prolongs  
Over others' mistake though it's weaker than all  
  
Sweet words spoken stings their prey  
As the mask falls apart revealing evil fangs  
Nation stands together for song they sang  
Only to fall apart, in evening's pray  
  
A fight over food, another over land  
A fight over principles and finally blood  
All that they stood for, all those now dead  
It's not what you want, for it's not grand  
  
Fight is life you say but was it the emblem  
That our nation held onto, to shake away the shackle?  
The piece you hold onto is wrong way to tackle  
The unity we stood by, will bring you happy realm  
  
We differ in all ways, we differ in colours  
But this difference is the reason to be connected  
Mark it in your head, with a remindful thud  
When colours come together, it's rainbow for others!  
  
The weakness and strength have never been foes  
Look at paintings beauty, if you have doubt  
The weak strokes of brushes bring life out  
While the strong strokes bind them afree of rows  
  
With colours diverged, life can be fine  
But without unity, those colours look forlorn  
Bring out inside's artist, beyond world's thorn  
Bring colours together, become the greatest sunshine  
  
Set aside the boundaries of nature and humans  
Spread out your arms, like eagle's wings  
Set world afire with love, burn inner demons  
Form the human chain, start the peaceful links!
