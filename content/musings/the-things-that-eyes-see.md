The things that eyes see  
And the things that my ears catch  
Collide together  
To build this mental sphere  
Where assumptions rule in monarchy  
And everything spins around me.  


Helios, I am, with deep blues  
And nascent green patches  
Rumbling thunders and raging summers  
And shimmering winters and springs of all colours  
These build me up into this ecosystem  
And that defines  
Who I am.  


Somewhere deep some voice cries  
To leave the sphere and drift away  
Towards the soothing scenes  
Of a simpleton's life.  
Crimson sunsets and a brown hut  
Loving parents and a caring sister  
Away from my own weather patterns  
Nearby their cozy presence.  
That's where I wanna stay forever.
