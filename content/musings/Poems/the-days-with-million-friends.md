Among the trees, I lay at night.  
Watching you friends, as trees fight.  
You winked, smiled, laughed and hailed.  
You old people, new blossoms of light.  


Times of year, the clouds stopped you.  
Thee, in the gaps, like rose bud’s dew.  
Kissed me to say, time moves away.  
Later, the year, ye hugged me, new.  


The years died like the trees cut down  
And now I’m old, drooped and brown.  
I live in a world where no one care,  
Unlike those days, when we weren’t alone.
