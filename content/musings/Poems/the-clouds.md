I saw a cloud  
Looking like a cart.  
It had two smart  
Deer without head  
Ridden by a red  
Hand of a beast  
Who was so tough and cruel  
And preparing for a feast.  
He ate up a Rusk  
And his head went apart  
Which changed into a mask  
With curling hair and heart.  
What happened to the cart?  
That had broken apart.  


Hey, Clouds! You are the strong  
Hiding the great sun.  
Oh, No! What are you doing?  
Striking the earth,  
By giving the birth  
To frightening lightning and thunder  
That time I thought, “How cruel you are!”  
The imitation of the devil.  


I don’t know why  
He began to cry  
Oh, what a wonder!  
Closing the beast’s file,  
Making us to smile.  
Oh, you are an angel at all!  
Oh, you are dying for all!  
You are a great creation over all.  
Thank you god for these all.
