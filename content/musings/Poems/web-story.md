In the interlocks of the unseen space  
He'd spit and draw some dreamy lines  
Against the wind he would enlace  
A grand structure of godly designs  
  
With four pairs of legs to hold him tight  
He'd sit there quietly in his humble abode  
When a flybyer comes in without an invite  
He'd leap and bind him with all web he could afford  
  
With his prey hanging there like a chandelier  
He'd feast like a king with an endless reign  
But the next day if you seek him, he'd be nowhere near  
For he is a nomad who leaves his old whims behind
